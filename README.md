# HackHealth
For HackHealth 2018 at Stony Brook, me and my team built a web app designed to help stressed out college students take much needed breaks to refuel and become more productive.

Our app made use of multiple frameworks and technologies, such as:
- Python, including the Flask framework (backend)
- HTML/CSS (front-end)
- Google Calendar API (backend)
- Spotify API (front-end)

This repository contains the backend portion of our project.  The front end repository is at this link: https://github.com/YormaxCastro/mindMusic
